## Overview of Projects

### Space Battle
Originally the project was to create a console game I took the project a bit further and added several features in how to battle using diplomacy and other stats, random number of randomly generated ships, and the ability to play multiple rounds that are tracked. Also added a basic website for accessing the game.

### Landscaper
The project was to create a console game I took the extra step to add DOM elements so you could play the game visually. I had decided to give the game a Halloween theme turning it into "Graveyard Landscaper".

### Flowerbox and Oscar
We were given mockup which we had to use our knowledge of HTML and CSS to recreate. These are visual pieces to show my comfort in styling modern website designs from a mockup.

### TODO List
This projects was to practice DOM manipulation with Jquery I added localstorage functionality so you could save your todos and load them later.

### Calculator
Another application to practice dom manipulation, this was actually more challenging than expected mainly due to some design choices that required me to add a few extra steps to extra the users input.

### Tic Tac Toe
A project with further DOM manipulation practice. I was able to complete the game logic along with win conditions and give it a Bill and Ted wrapper to make it more fun.

### NYC Complaints
Our first project that involved us fetching data from an API and displaying on the DOM.

### Pet Adoption App
Our UNIT 1 project we had to create an application that pull data from an API with some javascript UI elements like tooltips, modals and sliders. In this project I create modals and tools tips to help search for adoptable pets in the petfinder API.
