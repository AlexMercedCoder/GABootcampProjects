# Flowerbox

![desktop mockup](https://imgur.com/NXdGKhD.png)

For today's morning exercise, you're tasked with recreating the mockup above of a flower shop's site.

## Set Up

1. In today's `morning_exercise` directory, we've provided you with a `flowerbox` directory. Work in there.
1. Make sure you're inside the `flowerbox` directory then `touch index.html styles.css` files.
1. Open the directory in atom
1. Add boiler plate HTML to your `index.html`
1. Connect your `styles.css` and `index.html` together
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
1. We've provided you with all necessary images inside the `imgs` folder
1. So get started!

## Getting Started

It's up to you how you want to tackle this mockup, but remember a few concepts we talked about in the past:

- **Wireframing**: Consider wireframing the mockup so you have a better understanding of how you'll want to lay out your element tree and so forth.
- **Start with HTML first**: Consider laying out your HTML before even touching your CSS file so you know the parent-children relationships / what element belongs to what / what classes or what elements you used, which should make styling and flexing things a bit easier!  

Otherwise, though, have at it! Just recreate it the way you feel best.

## Resources

While the main focus here is for you to get the positioning correct, if you want to match everything exactly here are the fonts/colors that were used in the mockup!

**Fonts**

From [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

- DM Sans
- Open Sans

The social media icons you see in the footer are from what's called icon fonts. In particular, this one used

- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/)

But there are many out there! For example, check out:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/?from=io)
- [Linear Icons](https://linearicons.com/)
- [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/)

**Colors**

- Darker Pink: #f0a8bb
- Lighter Pink: #f9dde0
- Blue: #92b2ba
- Background: whitesmoke
- Tag Background, Footer Background: #eeeeee
- Tag Text: #777777

**Etc**

- Wondering how to get the shadow effect on the text in the header? Look into the [text-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow) property
- What about the shadow on the cards? There must be something similar to text-shadow but for divs instead, use your google-fu to find out!

## Hungry for More?

We learned about responsive design yesterday, now practice it! Feel free to style your own mobile design, or try to match the mobile mockup given below!

*Notice something weird when you try to look at the mobile view via the chrome dev tools? Look into [viewports](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp) to fix it!*

> Note that because you started with desktop view first, in order to keep with the mobile-first design concept, you will likely have to refactor your CSS a bit
